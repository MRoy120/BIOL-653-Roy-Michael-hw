# BIOL-653-Roy-Michael
##My First README using Git!

In order to edit this README, I first logged into Github and clicked on the button for my profile.  In my respositories, I chose BIOL-653-Roy-Michael, and then clicked on the pencil icon to edit this README.  And here I am!

Now I am editing this README in RStudio, that I hope will successgfully be pushed to my Gitbub account.  Here it goes! **bold**
